# ZScore scores

This repository contains various scores written for the ZScore networked music composition and performance system. 
Each directory is dedicated to a single score.
ZScore code can be found in [szcore repository](../szcore).

The available data contains various materials used in pre-composition process, score configuration files, notation files and the distribution content.

Notation is usually sketched out in Sibelius and then fully realised in Adobe Illustrator.

Some scores use INscore Viewer for notation visualisation while others rely on web browsers.

A static version of each score is available in pdf format. 
It is provided for information only as score as visualised on digital devices during a performance.

### Score Packages

Several [ZScore packages](https://bit.ly/zscorepackages), made for preformances of various scores, are available for
download. Packages contain all necessary score files required for a performance.
